- Tested the model only on google colab. Haven't tried it on my laptop.
- Link to the colab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AxcW8ALvVkLaIdX5DLbtUqmHdBdis43U?usp=sharing
- Takes about an hour to train images at 40k steps.
- I have also added the jupyter notebook in the current directory [Notebook](./GanCarPix2Pix.ipynb)
- I have used an online kaggle dataset of car images and built the mask of the car images. - https://github.com/Shatrugna-Strife/dataset/raw/main/car-segmentation.zip
